Here are links to all of the projects I completed this summer (2021) in my GIS class. This course was based in R, a programming language entirely new to me. I hope as you navigate through the links below you will be able to see my how skills develop over the course of this class.

#### [1. Building a project website](abbyvandenberg.github.io)

-This week I explored the foundations of a website, specifically that a .yml file is required for any website and acts as the map of the site.

-I was able to teach myself how to adjust the dimensions of an image, which I know will come in handy as I am always trying to make my projects more artistic. 

-I feel more comfortable creating new projects and directories using the terminal.

-Pushing and committing my work is becoming easier, I enjoy frequently checking my knit html to see how my work is progressing!
